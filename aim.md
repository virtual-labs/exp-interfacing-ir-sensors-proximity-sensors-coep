## Aim
To interface an IR sensor with an Arduino Uno to detect the presence of an object at a specific distance. This signal will be used to control a 12V DC motor and an LED through a 5V relay, while displaying the measured distance and status on an LCD.

## Objectives
-	Understand the working principles of an Analog IR sensor.
-	Learn to interface an analog sensor with an Arduino Uno.
-	Understand the role of an IR Emitter and an IR Receiver.
-	Learn to control a high-power DC motor and an LED using a low-power Arduino via a relay.
-	Program the Arduino to read sensor input and respond by controlling the output devices accordingly.
